    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer: What means to \"prompt\" a LLM is to give an input on it. It is very important because in order to generate the human language or content, you need an input before the program begins doing the work by itself.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 02\n",

When we stand on the ground, we are pulling down on the objects around us. For example, when we move our feet, we are pushing on the ground and causing it to move up and down. When we walk on a mountain or a hill, we are pulling the ground down towards us. Gravity is a force that is constant, regardless of where we are. It does not depend on the size or weight of the objects we are pulling down. Gravity is also a force of attraction, which means that objects that are closer to each other will gravitate towards one another.\n"
